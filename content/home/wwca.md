## Background

As many of you are aware, in 2012 we instigated a new initiative, the William Winsborough Commemorative Award, to both commemorate Will and to honour and recognize a leader in the field of Trust and Trust Management. We have since made the award to:

- Audun Jøsang (2012),
- Fabio Martinelli (2013),
- Christian Damsgaard Jensen (2014),
- Ehud Gudes (2015),
- Simone Fischer-Hübner (2016),
- Siani Pearson (2017),
- Theo Dimitrakos (2018) and
- Carmen McGago (2019).

To recap, the model of the award is based on TC11's Kristian Beckman award. The recipient would present an invited keynote at the IFIPTM conference, and be awarded a small memento.

Per the Beckman award, and tailored to our working group: "_The objective of the award is to publicly recognise an individual, not a group or organisation, who has significantly contributed to the development of computational trust and/or trust management, especially achievements with an international perspective. However this particular requirement will not necessarily preclude nominations of those whose main achievements have been made on a national level._".

## 2023

The timeline for 2023 has now started. We are now soliciting from the WG members, suggestions of names for the 2023 award based on the above objective and requirements. A short (one or two paragraphs is sufficient) exposition of why you are recommending the person would be greatly appreciated in helping the committee do its work. Feel free to suggest more than one name. In the event no-one is proposed, the committee will come forward with its own recommendations, so to make yourself heard and to help make the group active, please submit names! Our only restriction is that members of the working group executive are NOT eligible for the award, most particularly Chair (Christian Jensen) and Secretary (Anirban Basu).

The deadline for submissions of names is _TBD_. Submissions can be sent to the Secretary of the Working Group, Anirban Basu, at wwca@ifiptm.org ([website](#wwca))

The committee will deliberate and make a choice of the recipient by _TBD_. The recipient will give a keynote at IFIPTM 2023 (https://www.ifiptm.org/event/ifiptm2023/) and be invited to write a position paper for the proceedings.

The committee will be formed along the same lines as the previous committees. Chaired by the Working Group Chair -- Christian Jensen (Denmark Technical University, Denmark) -- the other members are the General Chair(s) of the Conference for the year (or their representatives), who for 2023 are Davide Ceolin (CWI, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), Ehud Gudes (Ben Gurion University, Israel), Nurit Gal-Oz (Sapir College, Israel), Tim Muller (Nottingham University, UK) and Carmen McCago (University of Malaga, Spain). Traditionally, the previous recipient is also on the committee, which brings Carmen McGago on board. 2023's young researcher (those who are quickly and successfully establishing themselves in the field) is _TBD_. Ex officio is Anirban Basu, the WG Secretary (who does not vote).
